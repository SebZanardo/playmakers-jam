CHOSEN IDEA - DEAD PIXEL
You play as a dead pixel on a computer screen. Puzzle platformer where you
stretch your body to navigate a world and collect more dead pixels to be able
to grow to larger sizes. Whenever you collect pixels the game is 'restarted'
and you are sent back to the first screen but can now expand to larger sizes so
you now have the ability to navigate more of the map. End of game is that you
have enough dead pixels to fill the screen, and then fake blue screen.
