CHOSEN IDEA - DEAD PIXEL

ACTUAL PLAN:
You play as a dead pixel on a computer screen. Puzzle platformer where you
stretch your body to navigate a digital world. You are on a strict timelimit
and everytime it runs out the game restarts... however, you retain your
collectables in the form of bugs (boids that fly around the map avoiding you)
which can be spent in an upgrade shop to increase one of three stats, time,
length and width. These stats once upgraded will allow you to explore the map
and once every stat is upgraded to the maximum you can finish the game with a
secret ending :)) crashing the computer.

INITIAL PLAN:
You play as a dead pixel on a computer screen. Puzzle platformer where you
stretch your body to navigate a world and collect more dead pixels to be able
to grow to larger sizes. Whenever you collect pixels the game is 'restarted'
and you are sent back to the first screen but can now expand to larger sizes so
you now have the ability to navigate more of the map. End of game is that you
have enough dead pixels to fill the screen, and then fake blue screen.
